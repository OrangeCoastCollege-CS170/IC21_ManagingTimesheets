Write a small Java program that declares a two-dimensional array (size 3 x 5) to manage the hours worked by each of your three employees on a five-day work week.  

Prompt the user to enter the hours worked for each employee as follows:

Please enter hours worked for employee #1 on Monday: 6
Please enter hours worked for employee #1 on Tuesday: 6.5
Please enter hours worked for employee #1 on Wednesday: 6 
Please enter hours worked for employee #1 on Thursday: 6.5
Please enter hours worked for employee #1 on Friday: 6.5

Please enter hours worked for employee #2 on Monday: 8.5
Please enter hours worked for employee #2 on Tuesday: 8.5 
Please enter hours worked for employee #2 on Wednesday: 8.5 
Please enter hours worked for employee #2 on Thursday: 8.5 
Please enter hours worked for employee #2 on Friday: 8.5 

Please enter hours worked for employee #3 on Monday: 10
Please enter hours worked for employee #3 on Tuesday: 9.5
Please enter hours worked for employee #3 on Wednesday: 14 
Please enter hours worked for employee #3 on Thursday: 12 
Please enter hours worked for employee #3 on Friday: 13.5 

Store all the data entered into the two-dimensional array.  After the three employees have been entered, please print a total hours and average hours worked per day for each employee by looping through the two-dimensional array.  For example, output might look like:

Total hours worked for employee #1 : 31.5
Average hours worked for employee #1 : 6.3

Total hours worked for employee #2 : 42.5
Average hours worked for employee #2 : 8.5 

Total hours worked for employee #3 : 59
Average hours worked for employee #3 : 11.8
